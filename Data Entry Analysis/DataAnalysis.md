# Problems:

1.	Data of 2 species of Zooplankton – Chippo and Cuni is maintained in same files which makes it confusing.
2.	The day and night distribution of data is difficult to maintain because the timings are not maintained.
3.	Missing Data in the columns “Temp”, “Density” and “Colony Diameter”.
4.	The zoop data file is collected in the year 2011 while pond data in 2010 which leads to false analysis.
5.	In "Chippo #L" column there exists certain negative values which are not valid.
6.	The columns in the data files are abbreviated and that doesn't provide a clear information and that makes it difficult to analyse. 
7.	Chlorophyll not recorded in ponds data.

# Solutions:

1. Chippo and Cuni should be in different spreadsheets.
2. Timings should be maintained and entered properly in the spreadsheet.
3. Deleting the data with missing values (provided it doesn't make a negative impact in the analysis).
4. Year in which data is collected is important for better analysis. Year should be same in all the 3 spreadsheets.
5. Column names should be simple to understand.

# Tables Format Suggestion

## Chippo Table

|  Date   | TIme   | Location   | Temperature    | Chippo #/L | Density   | ColonySize  | 
|---------|--------|------------|----------------|------------|-----------|-------------|

## Chuni Table

|  Date   | TIme   | Location   | Temperature    | Chuni #/L | Density   | ColonySize  |
